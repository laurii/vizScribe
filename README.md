# VizScribe
VizScribe is a browser-based application designed to aid protocol analysis (understanding subjects' cognitive processes by analyzing sequences of observations on their behavior).
Typically such observations require audio, video, and transcript data, and more recently, computer usage logs, biometric or sociometric sensor data, etc.
This tool is an attempt to help the analyst view data from these different sources together to get a coherent view of subjects' behavior.

We are also trying to make it easier for researchers to create their own views of such datasets.
