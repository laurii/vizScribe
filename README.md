# VizScribe
VizScribe is a browser-based framework designed to aid protocol analysis (understanding subjects' cognitive processes by analyzing sequences of observations on their behavior).
Typically such observations require audio, video, and transcript data, and more recently, computer usage logs, biometric or sociometric sensor data, etc.
VizScribe can help you view time-sequence data from these different
sources together to get a coherent view of subjects' behavior.
