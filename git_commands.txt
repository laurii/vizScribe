Commands to commit to remote repository
git add . (current directory)

git commit -m *message* (the message can be something like "work done
for cscw")

git push -u origin master

if there is a conflict, you will get an error message, at which point do
the following:

git pull

Then repeat the add, commit, and push commands, if there are no
individual file clashes. If there are file clashes one of course needs
to examine both versions of the conflicted files.

git repack -a -d -f --depth=250 --window=250

Run this command if your ".git" folder becomes too large.

BRANCHING
check out branch:
git checkout <branchname>

push to branch:
git push origin <branchname>
