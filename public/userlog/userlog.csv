4,00:00:23.000, 00:00:30.000,Scope of setup, Okay so -- I don't really think there's too many rules on what we can and can't do here.,4,00:00:23.000, 00:00:30.000,Analysis of Scope, Okay so -- I don't really think there's too many rules on what we can and can't do here.,6,00:00:32.100, 00:00:39.000,Analysis of Scope, I think it's just like a creative thinking exercise almost.,7,00:00:39.000, 00:00:44.000,Self-organization of design protocol, So--We should write down some ideas to-- Okay.,15,00:01:46.500, 00:01:52.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Come up with some examples of rules. What could we do?,13,00:01:38.000, 00:01:41.000,Self-organization of design protocol, What else? You wanna put some rules down?,16,00:01:53.000, 00:01:58.000,Category Addition, Well it depends. Do we want to do it on a battle or like a metropolis type idea?,17,00:02:01.000, 00:02:07.000,Category Addition, Or like a non-war design?,18,00:02:08.500, 00:02:12.000,Decision, Let's stick with battle for now and see what we come up with.,19,00:02:12.000, 00:02:20.500,Category Exploration, Okay so with a battle we can have some sort of war rules I guess? Okay.,20,00:02:20.500, 00:02:26.500,Category Exploration, Where you get somebody moves people and different guys can do different things. Yeah.,19,00:02:12.000, 00:02:20.500,Vertical, Okay so with a battle we can have some sort of war rules I guess? Okay.,20,00:02:20.500, 00:02:26.500,Vertical, Where you get somebody moves people and different guys can do different things. Yeah.,21,00:02:26.500, 00:02:30.500,Vertical, So turn it into like a Risk. Like a board game. Yeah exactly.,22,00:02:30.500, 00:02:40.200,Detailing, Do you have any problems with the iPads? No? Do call me. Thank you,24,00:02:46.000, 00:02:48.000,Decision, Yeah we can make it a board game.,27,00:03:08.000, 00:03:14.600,Decision, Okay so make it a board game so that means we're introducing--I mean there's gonna be a winner and a loser.,29,00:03:18.000, 00:03:24.700,Decision, And then we definitely move it to cooperative competitive in that situation.,27,00:03:08.000, 00:03:14.600,Category Analysis, Okay so make it a board game so that means we're introducing--I mean there's gonna be a winner and a loser.,25,00:02:48.700, 00:02:55.000,Category Exploration, We really could only like a really big one and you don't need a board almost.,12,00:01:29.600, 00:01:34.800,Self-organization of design protocol, Alright Increase the variety of figures. More realistic.,9,00:01:01.000, 00:01:04.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Tell me are we supposed to take notes on this?,31,00:03:48.500, 00:03:55.000,Category Analysis, Then we will be moving into something like chess. Just more rules there.,32,00:03:55.000, 00:03:58.000,Category Analysis, Yeah only be a pretty complicated game of chess. Yeah.,33,00:04:00.000, 00:04:07.500,Category Exploration, Would it be fun cuz like when kids play with action figures they usually make up their own rules anyway.,34,00:04:07.500, 00:04:12.349,Vertical, [cross talk] - this guy is better than this guy so--,33,00:04:00.000, 00:04:07.500,Vertical, Would it be fun cuz like when kids play with action figures they usually make up their own rules anyway.,36,00:04:18.700, 00:04:23.700,Horizontal, He's asking if we should focus on children a more mature...,38,00:04:32.000, 00:04:34.000,Instantiation, Like saying this guy's the commander he stays-- [cross talk 12:33]. Yeah I can buy that.,38,00:04:32.000, 00:04:34.000,Instances/Analogies, Like saying this guy's the commander he stays-- [cross talk 12:33]. Yeah I can buy that.,41,00:04:50.000, 00:04:55.000,Instances/Analogies, any terrain on your house. The terrain in the house would change how the game is played almost.,42,00:04:55.000, 00:05:03.000,Instances/Analogies, Actually so-- In third grade or whatever we had this game where there were two teams and each team would build towers.,43,00:05:03.000, 00:05:10.300,Instances/Analogies, And there was an army of catapults and these little crossbow looking things. You would try and shoot the tower down.,55,00:06:16.000, 00:06:19.500,Self-organization of design protocol, I wanna write this down instead of-- I'd be aiming at that guy's guy.,52,00:05:50.000, 00:05:59.000,Vertical, But like You'd have to shot from behind your gun. As you move your piece closer and closer you get a better shot. .,51,00:05:44.500, 00:05:50.000,Vertical, and you had to--it could only shoot so far and not very accurately.,49,00:05:30.000, 00:05:37.500,Instances/Analogies, Yeah like some air gun or something here that's like a pellet.,48,00:05:22.000, 00:05:29.000,Instances/Analogies, Mm-hmm. You could like -- I mean that could be things that would physically knock over other--,47,00:05:17.000, 00:05:22.000,Instances/Analogies, Cuz that's more active. It's not just like--it's all in your head and you have to move your pieces.,45,00:05:13.000, 00:05:15.000,Self-organization of design protocol, We can maybe incorporate that somehow.,56,00:06:19.500, 00:06:24.000,Vertical, Knock him over and he loses that guy. Mm-hmm.,51,00:05:44.500, 00:05:50.000,Detailing, and you had to--it could only shoot so far and not very accurately.,52,00:05:50.000, 00:05:59.000,Detailing, But like You'd have to shot from behind your gun. As you move your piece closer and closer you get a better shot. .,56,00:06:19.500, 00:06:24.000,Detailing, Knock him over and he loses that guy. Mm-hmm.,61,00:06:49.000, 00:06:57.000,Decision, Mm-hmm. That means we're placing value on terrain positioning what else?,61,00:06:49.000, 00:06:57.000,Detailing, Mm-hmm. That means we're placing value on terrain positioning what else?,62,00:06:57.000, 00:07:10.500,Instances/Analogies, Terrain positioning. Stuff like that. So essentially making it--simulating a war. Mm-hmm pretty much.,66,00:07:29.000, 00:07:36.000,Self-organization of design protocol, It also says to make sure each different idea is on a different sketch on the ski-Wiki.,67,00:07:36.000, 00:07:41.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Let's make sure that you save one. Make sure you're saving them.,68,00:07:41.000, 00:07:45.500,Self-organization of design protocol, Yeah but right now we're just typing it aren't we? Mm-hmm. Okay.,70,00:07:49.600, 00:07:57.900,Review of technique, Let me check out those scampers. So substitute is S C is combine A is adapt or amplify ,71,00:07:57.900, 00:08:06.000,Review of technique, M is [16:00] magnify or minimize P is put to other use. E is eliminate and R is rearrange or reverse.,72,00:08:06.000, 00:08:09.000,Decision, Do you think we should try to use that much more?,75,00:08:20.000, 00:08:24.000,Self-organization of design protocol, [Fading voice 16:19] how many of you guys have saved your things so I can't see them.,76,00:08:26.600, 00:08:28.600,Self-organization of design protocol, Mine should be saved.,96,00:10:54.000, 00:11:03.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Well we're crossing products right adding like hospitals and medics and stuff. Yeah.,97,00:11:03.000, 00:11:13.400,Self-organization of design protocol, Mm-hmm. It might help us think. If we can come up with--,98,00:11:13.400, 00:11:19.000,Category Analysis, I mean we can probably use this stuff on the page. We've already made it like chess ,100,00:11:22.000, 00:11:28.000,Category Analysis, We got the shooting aspect of it. It's competitive like sports.,92,00:10:19.000, 00:10:26.700,Self-organization of design protocol, What is it we need to do here? Crossing products yeah. What should that be?,93,00:10:41.000, 00:10:49.000,Review of technique, Okay crossing products. That's what he asked us to go check out that toy chest.,94,00:10:49.000, 00:10:52.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Absolutely we can cross it with some other stuff.,94,00:10:49.000, 00:10:52.000,Review of technique, Absolutely we can cross it with some other stuff.,95,00:10:52.000, 00:10:54.000,Review of technique, Okay. We don't have to.,95,00:10:52.000, 00:10:54.000,Self-organization of design protocol, Okay. We don't have to.,100,00:11:22.000, 00:11:28.000,Retrospective, We got the shooting aspect of it. It's competitive like sports.,101,00:11:28.000, 00:11:32.100,Retrospective, Made it more restrained like adding some rules.,31,00:03:48.500, 00:03:55.000,Foresight, Then we will be moving into something like chess. Just more rules there.,32,00:03:55.000, 00:03:58.000,Foresight, Yeah only be a pretty complicated game of chess. Yeah.,102,00:11:32.100, 00:11:36.800,Retrospective, It's still not really a physical game but that whole--,103,00:11:36.800, 00:11:39.700,Reflective, I mean it's slightly physical if you have to like [cross talk 19:40].,104,00:11:39.700, 00:11:48.500,Reflective, Oh yeah if you have to physically shoot your other person's thing. Yeah. That makes it a skill.,107,00:12:02.800, 00:12:09.300,Self-organization of design protocol, Next is sketch out your ideas on the tablets given. I think so. All right cool.,108,00:12:10.500, 00:12:14.660,Self-organization of design protocol, Okay. Should we split that up? Ummm-,118,00:12:57.000, 00:12:59.200,Decision, So different group have different toys ,119,00:12:59.250, 00:13:03.000,Decision, or we use the same one? No everybody's got different toys.,122,00:13:08.700, 00:13:13.600,Self-organization of design protocol, I don't know we're just sketching out our idea. We're all doing it separate and then we're ,123,00:13:13.610, 00:13:19.600,Self-organization of design protocol, gonna come together see if we get anything a little different. I really think we have a pretty solid ,124,00:13:19.620, 00:13:26.620,Self-organization of design protocol, single idea already. Make sure we keep things we were talking about early ,126,00:13:31.290, 00:13:38.200,Category Addition, The medics and the I guess the non-war type aspect of it that we could add in. ,126,00:13:31.290, 00:13:38.200,Retrospective, The medics and the I guess the non-war type aspect of it that we could add in. ,129,00:13:50.000, 00:13:54.500,Category Addition, I'm thinking we develop a kind of theme game such as on TV. ,132,00:14:05.500, 00:14:10.269,Instances/Analogies, the table. We shoot you and one soldier down. ,131,00:13:59.600, 00:14:05.500,Instances/Analogies, like in the game and we can invent a real scene like this one on ,136,00:14:25.300, 00:14:27.100,Horizontal, Yeah we play the game on TV. ,129,00:13:50.000, 00:13:54.500,Horizontal, I'm thinking we develop a kind of theme game such as on TV. ,137,00:14:27.100, 00:14:30.400,Instances/Analogies, It's like a console you're saying? On screen right? And we develop a ,138,00:14:30.400, 00:14:35.000,Detailing, a system that connect this into the TV. ,139,00:14:35.000, 00:14:38.500,Detailing, Mm-hmm. We strip one soldier down on TV ,140,00:14:38.500, 00:14:41.130,Detailing, and the ones that are down you will hit. Hmm. ,143,00:14:47.639, 00:14:51.339,Foresight, It's more reasonable and if you are a kid you need more [fading voice]. ,141,00:14:41.130, 00:14:45.800,Vertical, Yeah. Is it like the L shape? I don't like that.
