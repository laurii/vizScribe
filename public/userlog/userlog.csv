15,00:01:41.000, 00:01:42.500,test1, Mm-hmm definitely 
,9,00:00:49.600, 00:00:57.600,test5,Regarding gender we can increase variety of figures. 
,10,00:01:01.000, 00:01:04.000,test5, Tell me are we supposed to take notes on this? 
,11,00:01:04.000, 00:01:08.000,test5, Yeah I think so. Okay. 
,12,00:01:19.000, 00:01:27.000,test5, Okay [fading voice] text. Mm-hmm. It's [fading voice]. I don't really like how the texts works too much. 
,13,00:01:29.600, 00:01:34.800,test5, Alright Increase the variety of figures. More realistic. 
,5,00:00:23.000, 00:00:30.000,test4,so -- I don't really think there's too many rules on what we can and can't do here. 
,6,00:00:30.000, 00:00:32.100,test4, Okay. Yeah. 
,10,00:01:01.000, 00:01:04.000,test4, Tell me are we supposed to take notes on this? 
,11,00:01:04.000, 00:01:08.000,test4, Yeah I think so. 
,17,00:01:53.000, 00:01:58.000,test2,depends. Do we want to do it on a battle or like a metropolis type idea? 
,18,00:02:01.000, 00:02:07.000,test2, Or like a non-war design? 
,20,00:02:12.000, 00:02:20.500,test2, Okay so with a battle we can have some sort of war rules I guess? Okay. 
,21,00:02:20.500, 00:02:26.500,test2, Where you get somebody 
,26,00:02:48.700, 00:02:55.000,test2, We really could only like a really big one 
,14,00:01:38.000, 00:01:41.000,test1,What else? You wanna put some rules down? 
,15,00:01:41.000, 00:01:42.500,test1, Mm-hmm definitely rules. 
,16,00:01:46.500, 00:01:52.000,test1, Come up with some examples 
,32,00:03:48.500, 00:03:55.000,test1,moving into something like chess. Just more rules there. 
,33,00:03:55.000, 00:03:58.000,test1, Yeah only be a pretty complicated game of chess. Yeah. 
,34,00:04:00.000, 00:04:07.500,test1, Would it be fun cuz like when kids play with action figures they usually make up their own rules anyway. 
,35,00:04:07.500, 00:04:12.349,test1, [cross talk] - this guy is better than this guy so-- 
,36,00:04:12.349, 00:04:18.700,test1, Each edge we should focus
