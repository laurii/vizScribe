Start time, End time, speaker, dialogue
00:00:00.300, 00:00:06.300, speaker, You guys just as a reminder there's a toy chest here on the wall of 2166.
00:00:06.300, 00:00:12.000, speaker, That you can pull some other toys for inspiration when you're moving past categorizing.
00:00:12.000, 00:00:14.000, speaker, Okay. All right.
00:00:14.000, 00:00:16.000, speaker, Thank you. Yep.
00:00:23.000, 00:00:30.000, speaker, Okay so -- I don't really think there's too many rules on what we can and can't do here.
00:00:30.000, 00:00:32.100, speaker, Okay. Yeah.
00:00:32.100, 00:00:39.000, speaker, I think it's just like a creative thinking exercise almost.
00:00:39.000, 00:00:44.000, speaker, So--We should write down some ideas to-- Okay.
00:00:49.600, 00:00:57.600, speaker, So Regarding gender we can increase variety of figures.
00:01:01.000, 00:01:04.000, speaker, Tell me are we supposed to take notes on this?
00:01:04.000, 00:01:08.000, speaker, Yeah I think so. Okay.
00:01:19.000, 00:01:27.000, speaker, Okay [fading voice] text. Mm-hmm. It's [fading voice]. I don't really like how the texts works too much.
00:01:29.600, 00:01:34.800, speaker, Alright Increase the variety of figures. More realistic.
00:01:38.000, 00:01:41.000, speaker, What else? You wanna put some rules down?
00:01:41.000, 00:01:42.500, speaker, Mm-hmm definitely rules.
00:01:46.500, 00:01:52.000, speaker, Come up with some examples of rules. What could we do?
00:01:53.000, 00:01:58.000, speaker, Well it depends. Do we want to do it on a battle or like a metropolis type idea?
00:02:01.000, 00:02:07.000, speaker, Or like a non-war design?
00:02:08.500, 00:02:12.000, speaker, Let's stick with battle for now and see what we come up with.
00:02:12.000, 00:02:20.500, speaker, Okay so with a battle we can have some sort of war rules I guess? Okay.
00:02:20.500, 00:02:26.500, speaker, Where you get somebody moves people and different guys can do different things. Yeah.
00:02:26.500, 00:02:30.500, speaker, So turn it into like a Risk. Like a board game. Yeah exactly.
00:02:30.500, 00:02:40.200, speaker, Do you have any problems with the iPads? No? Do call me. Thank you
00:02:41.700, 00:02:46.000, speaker, Yeah there can be more strategy more board-like.
00:02:46.000, 00:02:48.000, speaker, Yeah we can make it a board game.
00:02:48.700, 00:02:55.000, speaker, We really could only like a really big one and you don't need a board almost.
00:02:55.000, 00:03:05.000, speaker, [Fading voice]. You guys can--this is good stuff.
00:03:08.000, 00:03:14.600, speaker, Okay so make it a board game so that means we're introducing--I mean there's gonna be a winner and a loser.
00:03:14.600, 00:03:18.000, speaker, Mm-hmm. Okay
00:03:18.000, 00:03:24.700, speaker, And then we definitely move it to cooperative competitive in that situation.
00:03:46.300, 00:03:48.500, speaker, Okay cool.
00:03:48.500, 00:03:55.000, speaker, Then we will be moving into something like chess. Just more rules there.
00:03:55.000, 00:03:58.000, speaker, Yeah only be a pretty complicated game of chess. Yeah.
00:04:00.000, 00:04:07.500, speaker, Would it be fun cuz like when kids play with action figures they usually make up their own rules anyway.
00:04:07.500, 00:04:12.349, speaker, [cross talk] - this guy is better than this guy so--
00:04:12.349, 00:04:18.700, speaker, Each edge we should focus on. Say that again?
00:04:18.700, 00:04:23.700, speaker, He's asking if we should focus on children a more mature...
00:04:23.700, 00:04:32.000, speaker, Yeah. I definitely think so. For children. Yeah but this can be made for adults also if you just make it like chess.
00:04:32.000, 00:04:34.000, speaker, Like saying this guy's the commander he stays-- [cross talk 12:33]. Yeah I can buy that.
00:04:34.000, 00:04:38.500, speaker, There's definitely that. Yeah you could. All right.
00:04:43.000, 00:04:50.000, speaker, This text box thing is-- That'd be cool if we didn't need a board and you could just play it on
00:04:50.000, 00:04:55.000, speaker, any terrain on your house. The terrain in the house would change how the game is played almost.
00:04:55.000, 00:05:03.000, speaker, Actually so-- In third grade or whatever we had this game where there were two teams and each team would build towers.
00:05:03.000, 00:05:10.300, speaker, And there was an army of catapults and these little crossbow looking things. You would try and shoot the tower down.
00:05:10.300, 00:05:13.000, speaker, Oh yeah sounds--that's pretty cool.
00:05:13.000, 00:05:15.000, speaker, We can maybe incorporate that somehow.
00:05:15.000, 00:05:17.000, speaker, That'd be pretty cool.
00:05:17.000, 00:05:22.000, speaker, Cuz that's more active. It's not just like--it's all in your head and you have to move your pieces.
00:05:22.000, 00:05:29.000, speaker, Mm-hmm. You could like -- I mean that could be things that would physically knock over other--
00:05:30.000, 00:05:37.500, speaker, Yeah like some air gun or something here that's like a pellet.
00:05:37.500, 00:05:44.500, speaker, Something like that. That'd be pretty cool. Yeah what if you had a little air gun okay 
00:05:44.500, 00:05:50.000, speaker, and you had to--it could only shoot so far and not very accurately.
00:05:50.000, 00:05:59.000, speaker, But like You'd have to shot from behind your gun. As you move your piece closer and closer you get a better shot. .
00:05:59.000, 00:06:07.000, speaker, Yeah If you're really far away you'll probably miss and the objective is to take out your opponents. Okay.
00:06:07.000, 00:06:10.000, speaker, Yeah I almost-- Okay.
00:06:16.000, 00:06:19.500, speaker, I wanna write this down instead of-- I'd be aiming at that guy's guy.
00:06:19.500, 00:06:24.000, speaker, Knock him over and he loses that guy. Mm-hmm.
00:06:24.000, 00:06:29.500, speaker, Cool. That would make the obstacles and stuff more valuable and
00:06:29.500, 00:06:32.700, speaker, Guys like this can hide behind obstacles a little better 
00:06:32.700, 00:06:36.000, speaker, because if you try to hit them it's gonna be harder to hit them.
00:06:36.000, 00:06:42.500, speaker, Then your terrain--if you hide your guys behind the terrain they can't get you.
00:06:49.000, 00:06:57.000, speaker, Mm-hmm. That means we're placing value on terrain positioning what else?
00:06:57.000, 00:07:10.500, speaker, Terrain positioning. Stuff like that. So essentially making it--simulating a war. Mm-hmm pretty much.
00:07:10.500, 00:07:18.500, speaker, You guys have any questions? Yeah one thing is you don't have to literally interpret all the scamper and all that.
00:07:18.500, 00:07:21.000, speaker, The goal is to create as many new play values as possible.
00:07:21.000, 00:07:23.000, speaker, Exactly. Okay. All right.
00:07:29.000, 00:07:36.000, speaker, It also says to make sure each different idea is on a different sketch on the ski-Wiki.
00:07:36.000, 00:07:41.000, speaker, Let's make sure that you save one. Make sure you're saving them.
00:07:41.000, 00:07:45.500, speaker, Yeah but right now we're just typing it aren't we? Mm-hmm. Okay.
00:07:45.500, 00:07:49.600, speaker, [Fading voice]
00:07:49.600, 00:07:57.900, speaker, Let me check out those scampers. So substitute is S C is combine A is adapt or amplify 
00:07:57.900, 00:08:06.000, speaker, M is [16:00] magnify or minimize P is put to other use. E is eliminate and R is rearrange or reverse.
00:08:06.000, 00:08:09.000, speaker, Do you think we should try to use that much more?
00:08:09.000, 00:08:14.000, speaker, I think we got a little bit on those. I thought we've done all that right now.
00:08:14.000, 00:08:17.000, speaker, We've heard it mentioned. Yeah.
00:08:20.000, 00:08:24.000, speaker, [Fading voice 16:19] how many of you guys have saved your things so I can't see them.
00:08:26.600, 00:08:28.600, speaker, Mine should be saved.
00:08:28.600, 00:08:35.300, speaker, I can't see. Try refreshing that box in the top right.
00:08:37.900, 00:08:40.000, speaker, I saved mine.
00:08:42.000, 00:08:48.000, speaker, I think I accidentally logged in as H1. Yeah there's two H1s. Yeah.
00:08:48.000, 00:08:53.000, speaker, Whoops. Here I'll log out and I'll log back in as H3. Okay.
00:08:53.000, 00:08:55.700, speaker, I'm H2 and [fading voice] one thing.
00:08:55.700, 00:09:02.000, speaker, I see your stuff now. There's no H3. Yeah I'm making mine.
00:09:02.000, 00:09:06.000, speaker, Yeah I see your--you've got the stuff now. Okay.
00:09:13.000, 00:09:18.000, speaker, Okay I should be--all right cool.
00:09:21.500, 00:09:30.000, speaker, Is it you? I should have--let me draw something real quick.
00:09:30.000, 00:09:36.000, speaker, I'm here. Oh that's cool. I can look at what stuff you have.
00:09:36.000, 00:09:41.000, speaker, Have you saved yours? No I don't really have anything.
00:09:41.000, 00:09:45.700, speaker, I don't see anything here so-- Yeah neither did I.
00:09:45.700, 00:09:50.000, speaker, How do I make a new one? Just plus. A new canvas?
00:09:50.000, 00:09:58.000, speaker, Yeah like a new page. A new page you just refresh it. Up top. Oh okay. Cool.
00:10:03.000, 00:10:04.500, speaker, Cool.
00:10:19.000, 00:10:26.700, speaker, What is it we need to do here? Crossing products yeah. What should that be?
00:10:41.000, 00:10:49.000, speaker, Okay crossing products. That's what he asked us to go check out that toy chest.
00:10:49.000, 00:10:52.000, speaker, Absolutely we can cross it with some other stuff.
00:10:52.000, 00:10:54.000, speaker, Okay. We don't have to.
00:10:54.000, 00:11:03.000, speaker, Well we're crossing products right adding like hospitals and medics and stuff. Yeah.
00:11:03.000, 00:11:13.400, speaker, Mm-hmm. It might help us think. If we can come up with--
00:11:13.400, 00:11:19.000, speaker, I mean we can probably use this stuff on the page. We've already made it like chess 
00:11:19.600, 00:11:22.000, speaker, which is on here a couple times.
00:11:22.000, 00:11:28.000, speaker, We got the shooting aspect of it. It's competitive like sports.
00:11:28.000, 00:11:32.100, speaker, Made it more restrained like adding some rules.
00:11:32.100, 00:11:36.800, speaker, It's still not really a physical game but that whole--
00:11:36.800, 00:11:39.700, speaker, I mean it's slightly physical if you have to like [cross talk 19:40].
00:11:39.700, 00:11:48.500, speaker, Oh yeah if you have to physically shoot your other person's thing. Yeah. That makes it a skill.
00:11:48.500, 00:11:52.000, speaker, Yeah. Also strategy at the same time.
00:11:52.000, 00:12:00.000, speaker, Yeah that's kinda cool. I kinda want to play this game now. It'd be pretty cool. Okay.
00:12:02.800, 00:12:09.300, speaker, Next is sketch out your ideas on the tablets given. I think so. All right cool.
00:12:10.500, 00:12:14.660, speaker, Okay. Should we split that up? Ummm-
00:12:16.600, 00:12:18.500, speaker, The sketching? Yeah.
00:12:18.500, 00:12:24.000, speaker, Or do you think--we can all sketch our idea and then we can come back
00:12:24.000, 00:12:26.740, speaker, in like five ten minutes or whatever. Sure.
00:12:33.000, 00:12:36.000, speaker, Hello. Hello.
00:12:36.000, 00:12:42.000, speaker, Don't mind me I'm just here. I'm thinking--I'm not gonna say oh wow - drawing.
00:12:42.000, 00:12:45.500, speaker, That's fine. Drawing's cool. We like drawings.
00:12:45.500, 00:12:51.700, speaker, Yeah we got the--a good toy I think. Really?
00:12:51.700, 00:12:55.639, speaker, Yeah. Oh dude army toys. Yeah I'm pretty stoked. Those are so sweet.
00:12:55.639, 00:12:57.000, speaker, No way.
00:12:57.000, 00:12:59.200, speaker, So different group have different toys 
00:12:59.250, 00:13:03.000, speaker, or we use the same one? No everybody's got different toys.
00:13:03.000, 00:13:06.100, speaker, Okay. Yeah. 
00:13:06.100, 00:13:08.700, speaker, What's that? Sorry what? What are we doing again? 
00:13:08.700, 00:13:13.600, speaker, I don't know we're just sketching out our idea. We're all doing it separate and then we're 
00:13:13.610, 00:13:19.600, speaker, gonna come together see if we get anything a little different. I really think we have a pretty solid 
00:13:19.620, 00:13:26.620, speaker, single idea already. Make sure we keep things we were talking about early 
00:13:27.000, 00:13:31.290, speaker, in there. Like the girl side of play almost.
00:13:31.290, 00:13:38.200, speaker, The medics and the I guess the non-war type aspect of it that we could add in. 
00:13:38.200, 00:13:43.400, speaker, Mm-hmm. Make sure that you keep that. All right. 
00:13:47.500, 00:13:50.000, speaker, Well if you want. If you think that's not important--
00:13:50.000, 00:13:54.500, speaker, I'm thinking we develop a kind of theme game such as on TV. 
00:13:54.500, 00:13:59.600, speaker, And we add this part. You know when we shoot each other 
00:13:59.600, 00:14:05.500, speaker, like in the game and we can invent a real scene like this one on 
00:14:05.500, 00:14:10.269, speaker, the table. We shoot you and one soldier down. 
00:14:10.269, 00:14:17.400, speaker, It's more visible and if you are hit you can feel more. Do you get my idea? 
00:14:17.400, 00:14:23.000, speaker, Wait what are you shooting--? Right why do you--what are you shooting? Why is there a TV in there? Yeah what are you shooting? 
00:14:23.000, 00:14:25.300, speaker, You shoot a TV you said? 
00:14:25.300, 00:14:27.100, speaker, Yeah we play the game on TV. 
00:14:27.100, 00:14:30.400, speaker, It's like a console you're saying? On screen right? And we develop a 
00:14:30.400, 00:14:35.000, speaker, a system that connect this into the TV. 
00:14:35.000, 00:14:38.500, speaker, Mm-hmm. We strip one soldier down on TV 
00:14:38.500, 00:14:41.130, speaker, and the ones that are down you will hit. Hmm. 
00:14:41.130, 00:14:45.800, speaker, Yeah. Is it like the L shape? I don't like that. 
00:14:45.800, 00:14:47.639, speaker, It's 3D right? That's cool. 
00:14:47.639, 00:14:51.339, speaker, It's more reasonable and if you are a kid you need more [fading voice]. 
00:14:51.339, 00:14:54.459, speaker, That's my idea. 
00:14:54.459, 00:14:55.600, speaker, No. You can just draw it. 
00:14:55.600, 00:14:57.120, speaker, [Cross talk 22:56] That's a good idea.
