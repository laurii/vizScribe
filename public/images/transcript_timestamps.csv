0:02,0:06,Todd,if you've got if you've got a switch there there there and there and it
0:06,0:12,Todd,only works if all four switches are down and that and that those switch
0:12,0:17,Todd,positions guarantee that the head is down then -  
0:17,0:21,Tommy,yeah that's the control everything approach isn't it yeah that's the yeah and you design it in
0:21,0:22,Tommy,such a way that that's a reasonably comfortable position and if you
0:22,0:28,Tommy,don't put it in that position it doesn't work
0:28,0:37,Jack,wouldn't it'd be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it worked
0:37,0:38,Todd,yeah but that's you can do the two together can you
0:38,0:39,Jack,yeah pick it up and go -
0:39,0:40,Alan,the other thing to to think about is in almost all cases when i look at pens the apart from
0:40,0:47,Alan, re-wired sort of micropens the th- tip is actually the narrowest part of the product whereas
0:47,0:55,Alan,in what we're looking at it could actually be as wide or wider -
0:55,0:57,Tommy,mmmm than-
0:57,1:01,Chad,so it's more like a paintbrush isn't it like a diy paintbrush
1:01,1:07,Tommy,yeah it's more like a roller more like a roller yeah
1:07,1:08,Alan,mmm
1:08,1:16,Todd,it's there's probably
1:16,1:21,Alan,if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that + that or a- because it would be here the print
1:21,1:31,Alan,head you could have an angle into there an angle into there so-
1:31,1:53,Jack,at least you don't smudge it yeah
1:53,1:53,Tommy,yeah
1:53,1:55,Alan,you could have some flexibility because of the metal on which it's hinged if you like
1:55,2:00,Tommy,yeah i think actually i wonder if you intuitively know how to use
2:00,2:01,Tommy,a roller because you're older than eleven and i wonder if it would be
2:01,2:01,Tommy,very intuitive if you've never seen one before 
2:01,2:01,Jack,my two year old rolls paints
2:01,2:01,Jack,[laugh] i wondered what you were going to say there
2:01,2:01,Tommy,[laugh] very liberal household dutch (like the trains)
2:01,2:02,Jack,but i guess this could be it could be i mean ok it's ten mill- but the
2:02,2:07,Jack,pen could be we could shape it so it does make it like a fine tip
2:07,2:13,Alan,yeah but there's an inherent size issue with holding it this way
2:13,2:14,Sandra,[laugh] yeah
2:14,2:22,Alan,because you're not going to have you you used to have these pens that
2:22,2:24,Alan,were ginormous and they had lots of different pens inside it
2:24,2:36,Jack,oh yeah 
2:36,2:36,Alan,yeah and they're all like this round and it
2:36,2:49,Alan,made it really difficult to write with at the right angle so i think there
2:49,2:50,Alan,is an issue about how big or how
2:50,2:51,Tommy,but you might not want to no
2:51,2:52,Alan,yeah i think that's worth considering actually 
2:52,2:52,Sarah,yeah i think so [laugh]
2:52,2:52,Chad,sorry what's that 
2:52,2:52,Alan,because the not having it in a pen shape the
2:52,2:58,Alan,not holding it like a pen but actually holding it in a different way like that or- 
2:58,3:03,Todd,yeah there are two there are two sides to this i think either you want to teach a child to re- + to hold a pen properly-
3:03,3:05,Alan,yeah which is a you know-
3:05,3:08,Chad,if you wanted to do that you'd give them a pen
3:08,3:08,Todd,[laugh] yeah but you've got to be taught how to hold a pen or else you do that 
3:08,3:12,Alan,otherwise you'd write like sandra
3:12,3:18,Sandra,[laugh] you can write a lot better actually you can write like this as well
3:18,3:22,Todd, yeah but that's /that's to do with
3:22,3:23,Alan,different people will write- 
3:23,3:24,Todd,not smudging the ink
3:24,3:24,Sandra,yeah
3:24,3:26,Alan,yeah different people will hold the pen between
3:26,3:29,Alan,these two fingers and write like that
3:29,3:31,Todd,yeah they're freaks [laugh]
3:31,3:34,Todd,they shouldn't be allowed
